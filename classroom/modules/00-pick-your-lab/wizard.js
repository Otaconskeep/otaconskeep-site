Route based on IP hash is the one that needs a matching static EtherChannel on the physical switch, with every uplink active. Broadcom’s note on KB 2006129: the hash is the source and destination IP. One pair of addresses stays on one uplink, so one copy to one server does not use both cables. A VM talking to several servers can land on more than one uplink.

The second moment is a moving average of the squared gradient, the uncentered variance. The step is the first, bias-corrected, divided by the square root of the second.',

The paper shows that skipping the correction hurts most when the second-moment decay is aggressive, because the early steps get huge. RMSProp is the close cousin without that correction. AdaGrad is the older method that keeps a growing sum of squared gradients and can stall. AdamW, from Loshchilov and Hutter, moves weight decay outside the adaptive step so the decay is not shrunk by the second moment. Modern language-model fine-tunes usually say AdamW, not the 2014 Adam alone.',

Quantization, the Q4 or Q8 in a model name, shrinks a trained file so it fits in less memory. Q4 is smaller and a bit less sharp. Q8 is closer to the original weights and heavier.

QLoRA keeps the base model quantized and trains the adapter, which is how a smaller card fine-tunes. It is still training.
