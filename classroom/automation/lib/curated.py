        """## Instruction

### Identity is not a username sticker

Linux authorization decisions use numbers first: UID and GID. The names in `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` are human labels. When a process opens a file, the kernel compares the process credentials to the inode's owner/group/mode. If your container runs as UID 1000 but the bind-mounted library is owned by UID 0 with mode `600`, the container cannot read it, no amount of “but I'm an admin in the UI” changes that.

### Read `ls -l` like a contract

Example line:

```text
-rw-r----- 1 media media 4096 Sep 22 08:00 library.db
```

- Type: `-` file, `d` directory, `l` symlink
- Owner mode `rw-`: owner may read/write
- Group mode `r--`: group may read
- Other mode `---`: everyone else denied
- Owner `media`, group `media`

### Users and groups for services

Do not run every homelab service as your login user or as root. Create a dedicated user (or reuse a documented service UID such as 1000:1000 only when you intentionally standardize PUID/PGID across containers, covered later). Prefer:

1. A group for shared libraries (example: `media`)
2. Service users that are members of that group when they must share files
3. Directories with group sticky collaboration patterns (`2775` style) only when you understand setgid directories

### Least privilege checklist

1. Prefer group-readable over world-readable
2. Prefer owning service user over root-owned config
3. Prefer `640`/`750` over `777`/`666`
4. Prefer ACL only when classic mode bits cannot express the need (later class)

### Worked example

You want Sonarr-like access to `/data/media` and a downloader to write `/data/torrents`. Wrong approach: `chmod -R 777 /data`. Right approach on a disposable lab:

1. `sudo groupadd labmedia`
2. `sudo useradd -r -g labmedia -s /usr/sbin/nologin labsvc`
3. `sudo mkdir -p /opt/lab-classroom/class16/{media,torrents}`
4. `sudo chown -R labsvc:labmedia /opt/lab-classroom/class16`
5. `sudo chmod 2770 /opt/lab-classroom/class16/media /opt/lab-classroom/class16/torrents`
6. Verify with `namei -l` and `sudo -u labsvc test -w ...`

### Guided practice

On your lab host, create `/opt/lab-classroom/class16` if missing. Create two users `alice16` and `bob16`, one group `team16`, put both users in the group, create a shared file owned by `alice16:team16` mode `640`, and prove `bob16` can read but cannot write unless you intentionally grant write.

### WARNING: privileged commands

The following use `sudo`, create users/groups, and change ownership. Do not point them at `/home`, `/`, or production media trees.

**Prerequisites:** disposable lab VM; confirm path with `realpath`.

1. Create workspace:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/lab-classroom/class16
sudo chown "$USER":"$USER" /opt/lab-classroom/class16
cd /opt/lab-classroom/class16
pwd

```bash
sudo groupadd class16g || true
sudo useradd -M -N -g class16g -s /usr/sbin/nologin class16a || true
sudo useradd -M -N -g class16g -s /usr/sbin/nologin class16b || true
getent group class16g
```

3. Shared directory with setgid group inheritance:

```bash
mkdir -p share
sudo chown class16a:class16g share
sudo chmod 2770 share
sudo -u class16a bash -lc 'echo hello > /opt/lab-classroom/class16/share/note.txt'
sudo -u class16a bash -lc 'chmod 640 /opt/lab-classroom/class16/share/note.txt'
namei -l /opt/lab-classroom/class16/share/note.txt
```

4. Verify access matrix:

```bash
sudo -u class16b bash -lc 'cat /opt/lab-classroom/class16/share/note.txt'
sudo -u class16b bash -lc 'echo fail >> /opt/lab-classroom/class16/share/note.txt' ; echo "write_exit=$?"
id class16a
id class16b
```

5. **Rollback / cleanup** (lab only):

```bash
sudo rm -rf /opt/lab-classroom/class16
sudo userdel class16a || true
sudo userdel class16b || true
sudo groupdel class16g || true

### Processes are the runtime truth

Dashboards lie; `ps` and cgroup views show what is actually running. For each critical service, you should be able to answer: PID, user, parent, command, and listening ports.

### Signals

- `SIGTERM` (15): ask it to exit
- `SIGINT` (2): interrupt (Ctrl+C)
- `SIGHUP` (1): often reload config (service-dependent)
- `SIGKILL` (9): force death, skips cleanup; can corrupt state

Prefer TERM, wait, then KILL only if needed.

### systemd mental model

A `.service` unit describes ExecStart, user, restart policy, and dependencies. `systemctl start` does not magically fix permissions; it runs the command in the configured context. Failed units leave evidence in `systemctl status` and the journal.

### Worked example

A user service that writes a heartbeat file every minute teaches enable/start/status/stop without touching system-wide units.

### Logs are evidence, not vibes

When a homelab service fails after reboot, the question is not “did you try restarting again?”: it is “what did the unit say?” The systemd journal stores stdout/stderr and structured fields from units. Learning `journalctl` turns outages into timelines.

### Essential filters

- `journalctl -u service.service -b`: this boot only for one unit
- `--since "1 hour ago"` / `--until`: time windows for change correlation
- `-p err..alert`: severity band when you need failures fast
- `-o short-iso`: readable timestamps for workbook paste
- `-n 200`: cap noise while learning

Always redact tokens, session cookies, and webhook URLs before sharing excerpts.

### Journal vs classic files

Many stacks still write under `/var/log` (nginx, apt history, auth.log). Professionals can move between both worlds: journal for unit lifecycle, files for app-native formats. On appliances without persistent journals, note that reboot may wipe volatile storage: configure persistence deliberately, not accidentally.

### Worked example

Capture errors since boot, then narrow to a unit you just restarted. Save a redacted excerpt under `/opt/lab-classroom/class18/` as workbook evidence. Prefer filters over dumping the entire journal.

### SSH is a front door

Most homelab administration still arrives over SSH. A weak front door (password auth on the public Internet, shared root passwords, unmanaged keys) eventually becomes an incident. This class builds a safe pattern: keys first, prove access, then harden: with console break-glass ready.

### Keys

Prefer Ed25519. Keep the private key private: never commit it, never paste it into Discord, never leave it unencrypted on shared storage without a passphrase unless the lab policy explicitly allows empty passphrases for disposable keys.

### Hardening order (memorize)

1. Install your public key (`authorized_keys`)
2. Open a **second** SSH session and prove login
3. Only then consider disabling password authentication
4. Run `sshd -t` before reload
5. Keep hypervisor/IPMI/console access documented

Never edit live sshd_config on a remote-only machine without a recovery path.

### Updates are change management

Package upgrades are not “click update.” They change libraries, kernels, and service defaults. Homelabs break when operators upgrade everything casually on Friday night with no snapshot.

### Safe rhythm (Debian/Ubuntu examples)

1. Take a VM or filesystem snapshot
2. `apt-get update` and capture the log
3. `apt list --upgradable` and skim high-risk packages (kernel, docker, openssl)
4. Apply upgrades in a maintenance window
5. `systemctl --failed` and smoke-test critical services
6. Reboot only when required: with console available

Avoid adding random third-party repositories for convenience; they expand your supply chain. Do not disable signature verification.

Keep SSH access available during remote upgrades. If a kernel ABI change requires reboot, schedule it deliberately and verify critical containers after boot using a short smoke checklist (DNS, reverse proxy, media stack health).

### From addresses to paths

Class 15 taught reading IP, mask, and gateway. This class focuses on **routing decisions**: how a host chooses an interface and next hop. When the destination is on-link, the kernel ARP/ND resolves neighbors. When it is not, the default route (or a more specific route) sends traffic to a gateway.

### Read `ip route`

Look for connected routes (your LANs) and the default route (`default` or `0.0.0.0/0`). Metrics break ties. Multi-homed labs and VLANs make wrong routes a common outage class: “ping works to the gateway but not to VLAN B” is a routing problem, not a Docker superstition.

### Practice mental model

Given `192.168.10.0/24` and `192.168.20.0/24`, two hosts need a router (or L3 switch) to talk. Document your lab’s addresses and routes before changing firewalls or reverse proxies later in the curriculum.

### The map of a Linux machine

Linux stores almost everything as files under a single tree rooted at `/`. Homelab work fails when you edit the wrong tree: production media under `/data`, configs under `/etc`, or a disposable lab under `/opt/lab-classroom`.

### Absolute vs relative

`/opt/lab-classroom/class16` is absolute. `../class16` is relative to cwd. Always confirm with `pwd` and `realpath` before destructive commands.

### Everyday landmarks

- `/etc`: system configuration
- `/var/log`: classic logs
- `/home`: user homes
- `/opt`: optional local software and our disposable classroom labs
- `/tmp`: temporary; may be cleared on reboot

### Worked example

Create `/opt/lab-classroom/class16/{configs,logs,bin}`, create a file, `cd` with relative paths, and prove location with `pwd` and `realpath`. Never point labs at `/data`.

### Small tools, composed

Unix philosophy: each filter does one job. `grep` selects lines, `sort` orders, `uniq` collapses duplicates, `wc` counts. Pipes connect them into investigations.

### Redirection hazards

`>` overwrites. On production logs this is catastrophic. In class, only redirect into `/opt/lab-classroom/class17/`.

### stderr matters

Failures often print on stderr. Use `cmd >out 2>err` or merge deliberately with `2>&1`: and document which you used in the workbook.

### Worked example

Create a sample log, filter ERROR lines, count them, and save with tee under the disposable lab path.

Practice reading exit status with `echo $?` after a successful grep and after a failing grep so you learn to trust pipelines in scripts without ignoring failures. Prefer readable multi-line pipelines over clever one-liners when you are learning.
