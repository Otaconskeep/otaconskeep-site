**Feynman teach-back is required in every lesson.**  
**Last reviewed:** {today_iso()}

## Backward design: module outcome

Student can navigate a Linux lab tree safely, compose shell pipelines for investigation, apply least-privilege users/groups/permissions, manage processes with signals and user systemd units, extract evidence with journalctl, and harden SSH with keys using console break-glass: all verified under disposable `/opt/lab-classroom/` paths.

## Bloom arc

Remember/Understand (paths, streams) → Apply (permissions, pipelines, journalctl) → Analyze/Evaluate (sshd hardening order, process signals)

## Module learning cycle

Orient → Recall → Learn (reading) → Demonstrate → Guided practice → Independent practice → **Feynman** → Lab → Quiz → Feedback → Module project → Module quiz → Exam → Reflect

**Module:** Module 06: Linux Foundations  
**Activity type:** Project (integrated Apply/Create)  
**Classes covered:** {", ".join(str(i) for i in ids)}  
**Lab risk:** medium (disposable paths + optional user systemd + ssh lab VM only)

## Objective

Deliver a single evidence pack proving you can navigate, pipe, permission, supervise, log, and SSH-harden a disposable lab without touching production `/data`.

## Deliverables

1. **Lab tree** under `/opt/lab-classroom/module06-project/` with `configs/`, `logs/`, `bin/`.
2. **Pipeline** that filters ERROR lines from a sample log into `logs/errors.txt` using grep|tee and reports a count.
3. **Identity**: a lab group and two lab users; shared directory mode proving group-read without world-write (no 777).
4. **Service**: a user-level oneshot systemd unit that appends a heartbeat line to `logs/heartbeat.log`.
5. **Journal evidence**: redacted `journalctl --user` excerpt for that unit.
6. **SSH notes**: screenshot or command transcript of key auth on a lab VM *or* a clearly labeled simulation documenting hardening order and break-glass console plan if no second VM is available.

## Verification checklist

- [ ] `realpath` shows all artifacts under `/opt/lab-classroom/module06-project`
- [ ] Pipeline evidence file exists and count matches ERROR lines
- [ ] `namei -l` shows non-777 shared directory ownership
- [ ] `systemctl --user status` shows oneshot success
- [ ] Journal excerpt redacted
- [ ] SSH section either proven or labeled simulation with recovery plan

## Rollback

```bash
systemctl --user disable --now module06-heartbeat.service 2>/dev/null || true
rm -f ~/.config/systemd/user/module06-heartbeat.service
systemctl --user daemon-reload
rm -rf /opt/lab-classroom/module06-project
# remove any lab-only users/groups you created for this project
```

## Security

No production paths. No `chmod 777`. No private keys committed. No sshd changes without console.

**Closed book preferred.**

1. What is the difference between an absolute and a relative path in the Linux filesystem?
2. Why does this curriculum forbid experimenting in `/data` during Module 06 labs?
3. What does `>` do differently from `>>` when used in a shell pipe/redirection workflow?
4. Which stream usually carries error messages?
5. What numeric identities does the kernel use for file access decisions?
6. Why is `chmod 777` usually wrong for shared lab or media directories?
7. Contrast SIGTERM and SIGKILL.
8. Give one `journalctl` flag that limits logs to the current boot.
9. What is the safe order for SSH hardening regarding password authentication?
10. Which command validates `sshd` configuration syntax before reload?

5. UID and GID.
6. It grants world write, destroying confidentiality and inviting accidents.
7. SIGTERM requests graceful exit; SIGKILL forces termination and cannot be caught.

**Timebox:** 60–90 minutes  
**Environment:** disposable lab VM/shell; console available if SSH tasks are live.

## Stations

### Station A: Navigate & evidence (Classes 16–17)
Create `/opt/lab-classroom/module06-exam/`, write a sample log, and produce `errors.count` via pipeline.  
**Pass:** absolute paths correct; count accurate; no writes outside lab path.

### Station B: Permissions (Class 18)
Create a shared directory proving group-read without world-write.  
**Pass:** `namei -l` evidence; write denied for non-group or others as designed; no 777.

### Station C: Process/service (Classes 19–20)
Install a user oneshot that logs a heartbeat; capture `systemctl --user status` and a journal excerpt.  
**Pass:** unit succeeded; evidence files present; redaction applied.

### Station D: SSH safety (Class 21)
Either (live) prove key login on lab VM with hardening notes, or (simulation) write a one-page hardening order + lockout recovery plan.  
**Pass:** order correct; break-glass documented; no unexplained sshd breakage.

## Rubric (100 points)

| Station | Points | Partial credit |
|---|---:|---|
| A | 25 | 15 if pipeline works but path hygiene weak |
| B | 25 | 10 if permissions work but 777 used (auto-fail security note) |
| C | 25 | 15 if unit runs but journal evidence missing |
| D | 25 | 15 if simulation complete but missing recovery |

**Passing criteria:** ≥80 total **and** zero critical safety failures (777 on shared tree, sshd change without console, writes outside `/opt/lab-classroom`).

## Remediation

If fail: identify weakest station → complete that class lab again → redo Feynman → re-sit only failed stations within one week.
